## Mapping between hardware event code and a software (EPICS) database event

#  EVR = EVR devObj name (auto expanded by parent)
#  EVT = Event code (hardware). Set EVT=0 to disable.

## Mapping between hardware event code and a special function of the EVR
## Each event can be mapped only to one function!
## There are some default events, that allways trigger specific functions!
## Available functions:
##		- Blink : An LED on the EVRs front panel will blink when the code is received.
##		- Forward : The received code will be immediately retransmits on the upstream event link.
##		- Stop Log (default event 121): Freeze the circular event log buffer. An CPU interrupt will be raised which will cause the buffer to be downloaded. This might be a useful action to map to a fault event.
##		- Log : Include this event code in the circular event log.
##		- Heartbeat (default event 122): This event resets the heartbeat timeout timer.
##		- Reset PS (default event 123): Resets the phase of all prescalers.
##		- TS reset (default event 124): Transfers the seconds timestamp from the shift register and zeros the sub-seconds part.
##		- TS tick (default event 125): When the timestamp source is 'Mapped code' then any event with this mapping will cause the sub-seconds part of the timestamp to increment.
##		- Shift 1 (default event 113): Shifts the current value of the seconds timestamp shift register up by one bit and sets the low bit to 1.
##		- Shift 0  (default event 112): Shifts the current value of the seconds timestamp shift register up by one bit and sets the low bit to 0.
##		- FIFO : Bypass the automatic allocation mechanism and always include this code in the event FIFO.

## Control for mapping a pulse geneator to an event code in hardware.
## Each pulser-function combination can be mapped to multiple events.
## Available functions:
##		- Trig : causes a received event to trigger a pulser. A pulse based on pulser polarity, delay and width will be outputted.
##		- Set  : causes a received event to force a pulser into set state(based on pulser polarity).
##		- Reset: causes a received event to force a pulser into reset state(based on pulser polarity).
#
## Pulser polarity defines the pulser set and reset state:
##		- Active high: Output is logic high in set state and logic low in reset state
##		- Active low: Output is logic low in set state and logic high in reset state

## UNIV-LVPECL-DLY Delay module
## This delay module can be inserted in one of the two available UNIV slots.
## This module will delay any signal from the FrontUnivOut output. The delay can be configired from 2200ps to 12430ps, with 10ps resolution.
## When the delay module is inserted, uncomment bottom macro substitutions for the appropriate slot.
