COMPILATION
===========

To complile to a PSI style module (loadable with require) run make in this folder.

Compilation will only work on a PSI infrastructure where the correct applications and environment variables are already configured.


DATABASES
=========

PSI databases should be prepared separately using the provided script:

cd mrfioc2/PSI
./make_databases.sh

The script should be executed in the PSI folder otherwise you need to specify the top folder of mrfioc2 with the -t switch:

cd /tmp
<top_mrfioc2_folder>/PSI/make_databases.sh -t <top_mrfioc2_folder>

Databases are automatically expanded in the ./db folder but you can also change the output folder with the -o switch:

cd mrfioc2/PSI
./make_databases.sh -o /home/johndoe/workspace/PSI/databases

cd mrfioc2/documentation
Doxygen
