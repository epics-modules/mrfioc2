COMPILATION
===========

To complile the IOC use the makefile provided in the PSI folder:

cd mrfioc2
cp PSI/makefile .
make -f makefile

Compilation will only work on a PSI infrastructure where the correct applications and environment variables are already configured.


DATABASES
=========

PSI databases should be prepared separately using the provided script:

cd mrfioc2/PSI
./make_databases.sh

The script should be executed in the PSI folder otherwise you need to specify the top folder of mrfioc2 with the -t switch:

cd /tmp
<top_mrfioc2_folder>/PSI/make_databases.sh -t <top_mrfioc2_folder>

Databases are automatically expanded in the ./db folder but you can also change the output folder with the -o switch:

cd mrfioc2/PSI
./make_databases.sh -o /home/johndoe/workspace/PSI/databases


EXAMPLE STARTUP SCRIPT
======================

PSI folder contains an example st.cmd file for the VME platform named example_st.cmd.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Documentation is located in the documentation folder and be expanded into HTML using Doxygen:

cd mrfioc2/documentation
Doxygen

A folder named html is created in the documentation folder. Open the index.html file in that folder. The first page contains the changelog as well as links to other pages.
