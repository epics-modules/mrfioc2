COMPILATION
===========

To complile the IOC use the makefile provided in the PSI folder:

cd mrfioc2
cp PSI/makefile ../
make -f makefile

Compilation will only work on a PSI infrastructure where the correct applications and environment variables are already configured.


DATABASES
=========

PSI databases should be prepared separately using the provided script:

cd mrfioc2
./PSI/make_databases.sh

The databases will be installed in the ./db folder where the script was ran from.
