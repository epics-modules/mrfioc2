# Control for mapping a function to an event code in hardware
#
# Macros:
#  NAME = record name
#  OBJ = EVR devObj name
#  func = Function to be mapped
#    Choices are: "FIFO", "Latch TS", "Blink", "Forward",
#                 "Stop Log", "Log", "Heartbeat", "Reset PS",
#                 "TS reset", "TS tick", "Shift 1", "Shift 0",
#
# Blink
#   An LED on the EVRs front panel will blink when the code is received.
#
# Forward
#   The received code will be immediately retransmits on the upstream event link.
#
# Stop Log
#   Freeze the circular event log buffer. An CPU interrupt will be raised which will cause the buffer to be downloaded. This might be a useful action to map to a fault event.
#
# Log
#   Include this event code in the circular event log.
#
# Heartbeat
#   This event resets the heartbeat timeout timer.
#
# Reset PS
#   Resets the phase of all prescalers.
#
# TS reset
#   Transfers the seconds timestamp from the shift register and zeros the sub-seconds part.
#
# TS tick
#   When the timestamp source is 'Mapped code' then any event with this mapping will cause the sub-seconds part of the timestamp to increment.
#
# Shift 1
#   Shifts the current value of the seconds timestamp shift register up by one bit and sets the low bit to 1.
#
# Shift 0
#   Shifts the current value of the seconds timestamp shift register up by one bit and sets the low bit to 0.
#
# FIFO
#   Bypass the automatic allocation mechanism and always include this code in the event FIFO.
