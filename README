The following is a brief tour of the important locations in the source tree
relating to the EVR.

==== mrfCommon ====

Some support functions.  Contains 'mrfCommonIO.h' which devices macros
for access to memory mapped IO.  Also the support a library and CLI utilities
for en/decoding the control word for the fractional synthesizer used on
EVRs and EVGs.

==== pciApp ====

OS independent abstraction for working with PCI devices.

==== vmeApp ====

OS independent abstraction for working with VME64x devices.

==== evrApp ====

The MRF IOC has a strong seperation between device and driver support.
The device support and interface definition are in this module.
The interface is defined by the C++ abstract base classes in 
'evrApp/src/evr/'.
A set of device support routines using is found in 'evrApp/src/dev*.cpp'.
Some generic database files are found in 'evrApp/Db/'.

==== evrMrmApp ====

The is the device support for the Modular Register Map (MRM) firmware
version for the EVR.
It provides a concrete implimentation of the abstract classes defined
in 'evrApp'.
It also provided IOC shell function in 'evrMrmApp/src/drvemIocsh.cpp'.
'evrMrmApp/Db/evr-*.substitutions' will create a complete example
database.
An example IOC using the database is in 'iocBoot/iocevrmrm/'.
