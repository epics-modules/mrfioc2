    Further delays/events are ignored.

@subsection v203 2.0.3 (Aug 2014)

@subsubsection v203bug Bug fixes

- Linux only.  Fix for ISR race condition which can leave interrupts disabled.
   Anyone running mrfioc2 on Linux is encouraged to update.
- fix rounding in CML/GTX WF calculator
- evgSoftSeq.py: fix sequences of length 1
- seqconst: avoid memory bounds violation
- fix EVG Univ inputs (fixed by Jonah Weber of LBNL)

@subsubsection v203feat Features

- linux: emulate parallel port JTAG cable.
   Allows firmware update w/o the Linux GPIO userspace interface (still not built on Debian stock kernels)
- Python helper scripts with example for NSLS2 EVG magic numbers.

@subsection v202 2.0.2 (Aug 2013)

@subsubsection v202not Notices

- I am considering removal of the EVR interface class.  This was originally
  intended to allow "similar" hardware (pre-MRM cards from MRF).  However,
  to my knowledge this has not been done.  If anyone is using this feature
  please contact me (mdavidsaver@gmail.com) or it will likely be removed
  in the next (2.1) release.

@subsubsection v202bug Bug fixes

- Fixed issues with EVG sequencer which allowed some user inputs at inappropriate times.
     This could cause the sequencer to stop.
     Sequencer controls now validated against internal state.
- wrong width for RVAL causes endianness issue
- re-enable of CML output during setMode not conditional
- Fix EVG driver init w/o hardware.  This was crashing.
- Update locking for EVR.  Take lock for all device support actions.
- Fix locking error causing EVR driver to hang during IOC shutdown.
- evgSoftSeq.py handle readback of zero length sequences (the initial condition)

@subsubsection v202feat Features

- Corrected the number of pulsers (delay generators) in EVRs. This adds 6 for a total of 16.
- Updated recommended firmware version for PCI EVRs to 6.
- Compile in VCS version or release number.  Add a PV which reads this.
- Read SFP EEPROM information (eg. module serial#, temperature, and incoming optical power).
    Requires firmware >=5.  For version 5 must be from 25 May 2012 or later.
- Add mapping record for Prescaler reset action to the example EVR databases.
- Support and documentation for firmware update of PMC-EVR-230 devices on Linux.
- PV with device position (VME slot or PCI BDF ids)
- Add aSub functions to support NSLS2 injector timing sequence constructor
    - Seq Repeat - Repeats a fixed sequence at specific intervals.  Includes
                   a bit mask to mask out certain occurences.
    - Seq Merge  - Merge two or more sorted sequences while maintaining sorting.
- evgSoftSeq.py In addition to the previous form, the sequence editor GUI now
                 accepts a single command line argument with the PV name prefix.
- evgSoftSeq.py Improved connection handling.
- configure/RELEASE Optionally include caputlog module
- Added enable/disable control for individual EVR outputs.
   Disabled output are mapped to Force Low.
- On Linux, allow the EVR driver to provide time to the system NTPD.
   Allows system clock to be synced to EVR with much lower jitter
   then network NTP server.
- EVG sequencer in single shot mode now shows status disabled on completion.
- Add evrsoftgate.db which uses a hardware event to enable/disable an
  output using a software timer.
- Add evgUserEvt.db which gives a "safe" software event send control.


@warning The default mapping for prescaler reset is now disabled.
         The included database files have been updated.
         Anyone who has created a custom database should update their database
         to include a "Reset PS" mapping record!

@subsection v201 2.0.1 (Apr. 2012)

@subsubsection v201bug Bug fixes

@li Fix several vxWorks build issues
@li Correct initial mapping for EVR output channels to Force Low (aka. Off)
@li Fix readback of EVG sequencer run mode.
@li Limit number of soft event send retries
@li More check for EVG and EVR during initialization.
     Should now catch old firmware versions and CSR address mapping problems.
@li Delay enabling VME interrupts for EVG until later during IOC startup.
@li Fix autosave/restore of CML output bit patterns.
@li Remove rear transition module definitions from default EVG db template
@li Fix locking issue in data buffer tx/rx.
    A deadlock would occur when trying to send a buffer with the link mode
    set to dbus only.

@subsubsection v201feat Features

@li Added evralias.db to facilitate creation of PV name aliases for EVR
    delay generator channels.
@li Always reset all EVG multiplexed counters when a divider value is changed.
@li Add counter to track number of times each EVG sequencer is run.
@li Add mrmEvrForward() shell function to configure EVR event forwarding to downstream EVRs.

@subsection ver20 2.0 (Sept. 2011)

@li Initial release.
