System Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to act as a guide and reference when using
 the 'mrfioc2' EPICS support module for the Micro Research Finland (MRF

 It describes software for using the Event Generator (EVG

) and Event Receiver (EVR

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MRF Event Timing System can be deployed in two configurations (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "img:sys:confs"

\end_inset

).
 The first is a unidirectional broadcast from a single source (EVG) to multiple
 destinations (EVRs).
 The Repeater

description "\"Dumb\" hub.  Has one input and many outputs."

\end_inset

 devices simply retransmit its single input to all outputs (one to many).
 In the second configuration a return path from many EVRs back up to single
 central (master) EVR is added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An EVR will act in one of two roles: either Leaf or Master.
 The Master EVR is necessary because, while the generator (EVG) is capable
 of receiving an event stream, it does not impliment the features of the
 receiver (EVR).

\begin_layout Standard
What is transmitted over the event link is a combination of 8-bit event
 codes and data.
 Data can take the form of a single 8-bit byte which is simply copied from
 sender to receiver (the Distributed Bus or DBus), and optionally a variable
 length byte array (Data Buffer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two types of data can be combined in two ways (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "img:wire:frames"

\end_inset

) depending on whether or not the Data Buffer feature is used.
 In configuration A every 16-bit frame is split between an 8-bit event and
 the 8-bit Distributed Bus.
 In configuration B every frame carries an 8-bit event with the Distributed
 Bus or a Data Buffer byte sent in alternating frames.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to data, the use of 8b10b encoding on the event link allows
 the local oscillator of each EVR to be phase locked to a reference sent
 by the EVG.
 The EVG itself is typically driven from an external oscillator.

\begin_layout Standard
When discussing the MRF timing system there are three clocks.
 The external reference clock for the EVG, the bit clock for transceivers,
 and the Event Clock.
 The relation between the reference and the Event clocks is determined by
 a programmable divider in the EVG and is usually a small integer number
 (eg.
 4).
 The Event clock must be in the range between 50MHz and 125MHz.
 The relation between the Event clock and the bit clock is a fixed factor
 of 20 which is determined by the frame size described above.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Event Link Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data which is transferred over the event link is interpreted in four ways:
 Event Codes, DBus bits, Data Buffers, and Clock Phase.
 Each carries a different meaning, and is used in different ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Event Codes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An event is momentary.
 Typically an event causes something to happen (a trigger).
 The 255 usable event codes available in the MRF system can be thought of
 as 255 seperate physical wires.
 On every tick of the Event Clock a pulse is sent on one (and only one)
 of the ``wires''.
 Zero is the ``idle'' event which is sent when no other event is queued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Event Codes will most often be used as triggers for external delay channels.
 However, there are a number of event codes which have special meaning in
 the MRF system.
 The meaning of all other codes is left to the system operator.

Distributed Bus (DBus) bits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Distributed Bus (DBus
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "DBus"
description "Distributed Bus.  Special state stored on EVR and periodically updated from EVG."

\end_inset

) consists of 8 bits of data which are stored on every EVR.
 This data is initialized to zero when the EVR starts, and overwritten whenever
 the EVR receives an event frame with DBus data.
 Depending on configuration this is either every frame, or every second
 frame (See fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "img:wire:frames"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DBus can thus be used to distribute either periodic, or non-periodic,
 signals with bandwidth up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

) of the Event clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bits of the DBus can be routed to physical output.
 A special feature of DBus bit 4 allows its rising edge to increment the
 timestamp counter (depending on mode).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data Buffers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When enabled, a protocol is used to broadcast arbitrary byte arrays from
 the EVG to all EVRs.
 Bytes are sent one at a time in the data part of every second frame.
 Special 8b10b codes are used to mark the beginning and end for each transfer.
 A simple checksum is also sent.
 The 230 series hardware allows buffers up to 2047 bytes in length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In keeping with the convention of the original MRF EPICS Support package
 the first byte of a buffer is used as a header (Protocol ID) to identify
 it.
 No restrictions are placed on the body of buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Event Clock Phase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of 8b10b encoding allows each EVR's local oscillator to lock to
 the EVG's reference clock.
 This allows operation at speeds higher then the event clock rate.
 This is used by the CML outputs described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:evr:cml"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Global Time Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model of time implemented by the MRF hardware is two 32-bit unsigned
 integers: counter, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seconds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The counter is maintained by each EVR and incremented quickly.
 The value of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seconds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is sent periodically from the EVG at a lower rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

second
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 33 special codes (see sec.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:spec:codes"

\end_inset

) must be sent.
 The first 32 are the shift 0/1 codes which contain the value of the next
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

second
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The last is the timestamp reset event.
 When received this code transfers the new 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

second
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 value out of the shift register, and resets the counter to zero.
 These actions start the next 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

second
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that while it is referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seconds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 this value is an arbitrary integer which can have other meanings.
 Currently only one time model is implemented, but implementing others is
 possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Light Source Time Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seconds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 value is an actual 1Hz counter.
 The software default is the POSIX time of seconds since 1 Jan.
 1970 UTC.
 Each new second is started with a trigger from an external 1Hz oscillator,
 usually a GPS receiver.
 Most GPS receivers have a one pulse per second (PPS
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "PPS"
description "Pulse Per Second. 1Hz clock"

\end_inset

) output.
 Time is converted to the EPICS epoch (1 Jan.
 1990) for use in the IOC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several methods of sending the seconds value to the EVG are possible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
External hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
has been created by Diamond light source which communicates with a GPS receiver
 over a serial (RS232) link to receive the timestamp and connects to two
 external inputs on the EVG.
 These inputs must be programmed to send the shift 0/1 codes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Time from an NTP server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
can be used without special hardware.
 This requires only a 1Hz (PPS) signal coming from the same source as the
 NTP time.
 Several commerial vendors supply dedicated NTP servers with builtin GPS
 receivers and 1Hz outputs.
 A software function is provided on the EVG which is triggered by the 1Hz
 signal.
 At the start of each second it sends the next second (current+1), which
 will be latched after the following 1Hz tick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Receiver Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Internally an EVR can be thought of as a number of logical sub-units (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "img:evr:blocks"

\end_inset

) connecting the upstream and downstream event links to the local inputs
 and outputs.
 These sub-units include: the Event Mapping Ram, Pulse Generators, Prescalers
 (clock dividers), and the logical controls for the physical inputs and
 outputs.

Pulse Generators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each pulse generator has a an associated Delay, Width, Polarity (active
 low/high), and (sometimes) a Prescaler (clock divider).
 When triggered by the Mapping Ram it will wait for the Delay time in its
 inactive state.
 Then it will transition to its active state, wait for the Width time before
 transitioning back to its inactive state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resolution of the delay and width is determined by the prescaler.
 A setting of 1 gives the best resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the Mapping Ram can force a Pulse Generator into either state
 (Active/Inactive).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Event Mapping Ram
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Event Mapping Ram is a table used to define the actions to be taken
 by an EVR when it receives a particular event code number.
 The mapping it defines is a many-to-many relations.
 One event can cause several actions, and one action can be caused by several
 events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The actions which can be taken can be grouped into two catagories: Special
 actions, and Pulse Generator actions.
 Special actions include those related to timestamp distribution, and the
 system heartbeat tick (see

 for a complete list).
 Each Pulse Generater has three mapable actions: Set (force active), Reset
 (force inactive), and Trigger (start delay program).
 Most applications will use Trigger mappings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prescalers (Clock Divider)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prescaler sub-units take the EVR's local oscillator and output a lower frequency
 clock which is phased locked to the local clock, which is in sync with
 the global master clock.
 The lower frequency must be an integer divisor of the Event clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Outputs (TTL)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sub-unit represents a local physical output on the EVR.
 Each output may be connected to one source: a Distributed Bus bit, a Prescaler,
 or a Pulse Generator (see

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current Mode Logic outputs can send a bit pattern at the bit rate of the
 event link bit clock (20x the Event Clock).
 This pattern may be specified in one of three possible ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As four 20 bit sub-patterns (rising, high, falling, and low).
 As two periods (high and low).
 These specify a square wave with variable frequency and duty factor.
 As an arbitrary bit pattern (<= 40940 bits) which begins when the output
 goes [TODO: high or low?].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sub-pattern mode.
 The rising and falling patterns are transmitted when the output level changes,
 while the high and low patterns are repeated in between level changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GTX outputs found only on the EVRTG (
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-}$
\end_inset

gun) receiver function similarly to the CML outputs at twice the frequency.
 Thus for this device patterns are 40 bits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An EVR's local TTL input can cause several actions when triggered.
 It may be directly connected to one of the upstream Distributed Bus bits,
 it may cause an event to be sent on the upstream links, or applied to the
 local Mapping Ram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rising edge of a local input can be timestamped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Global Timestamp Reception
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each EVR receives synchronous time broadcasts from an EVG.
 Software may query the current time at any point.
 The arrival time of certain event codes can be saved as well.
 This can be accomplished with the 'event' record device support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each EVR may be configured with a different method of incrementing the timestamp
 counter.

mrfCommon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some support functions.
 Contains 'mrfCommonIO.h' which devices macros for access to memory mapped
 IO.
 Also the support a library and CLI utilities for en/decoding the control
 word for the fractional synthesizer used on EVRs and EVGs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
mrmShared
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contains code shared between the EVR and EVG.
 This includes data buffer transmission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also contains the Linux kernel driver stub to allow userspace PCI operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
evrApp
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MRF IOC has a strong seperation between device and driver support.
 The device support and interface definition are in this module.
 The interface is defined by the C++ abstract base classes in 'evrApp/src/evr/'.
 A set of device support routines is found in 'evrApp/src/dev*.cpp'.
 Some generic database files are found in 'evrApp/Db/'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
evrMrmApp

) firmware version for the Event Receiver.
 It provides a concrete implementation of the abstract classes defined in
 'evrApp'.
 It also provides IOC shell functions to instantiate a device in 'evrMrmApp/src/
drvemIocsh.cpp'.
 'evrMrmApp/Db/evr-*.substitutions' will create a complete example database.
 An example IOC using the database is in 'iocBoot/iocevrmrm/'.

All EVGs and EVRs in an IOC are identified by an unique name.
 This is first given in the IOC shell functions described below, and repeated
 in the INP or OUT field of all database records which reference it.
 Both EVGs, and EVRs share the same namespace.
 This restriction is needed since some code is shared between these two
 devices.

\begin_layout Subsection
PCI Setup in Linux
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use PCI EVRs in the Linux operating system a small kernel driver
 must be built and loaded.
 The source for this driver is found in 'mrmShared/linux/'.
 This directory contains a Makefile for use by the Linux kernel build system
 (not EPICS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To build the driver you must have access to a configured copy of the kernel
 source used to build the target system's kernel.
 If the build and target systems use the same kernel, then the location
 will likely be '/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build'.
 In case of a cross-built kernel the location will be elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To build the module for use on the host system:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

$ sudo depmod -a
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the module is installed on the running target the special device file
 associated with each EVR must be created.
 If your target system is running UDEV this will happen automatically, if
 not then you must do the following.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If may be necessary to change the file permission to allow the IOC process
 to open it.

 a rules file.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each additional device adds one to the number (uio1, uio2, ...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the device file exists with the correct permissions the IOC will be
 able to location it based on the bus:device.function given an to mrmEvrSetupPCI(
).

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Example Databases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MRFIOC2 module includes example database templates for all supported
 devices (see 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 While each is fully functional, it is expected that most sites will make
 modifications.
 It is suggested that the original be left unchanged and a copy be made
 with the institute name and other information as a suffix.
 (evr-pmc-230.substitutions becomes evr-pmc-230-nsls2.substitutions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors would like to encourage users to send their customized databases
 back so that they may be included as examples in future releases of MRFIOC2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The templates consist of a substitutions file for each model (PMC, cPCI,
 VME-RF).
 This template instanciates the correct number of records for the inputs/outputs
 found on each device.
 It also includes entries for event mappings and database events which will
 be frequent targets for customization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each substitutions file will be expanded during the build process with the
 MSI utility to create a database file with two undefined macros (P and
 C).
 'SYS' and 'D' define a common prefix shared by all PVs and must be unique
 in the system.
 'EVR' is a card name also given as the first argument of one of the mrmEvrSetup
*() IOC shell functions (unique in each IOC).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus an IOC with two identical VME cards could use a configuration like:

Implementation Details

\begin_layout Standard
Details of some parts of the driver which may be useful in understanding
 (and trouble shooting) the behavior of the driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Event code FIFO Buffer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each EVR implements a hardware First In First Out buffer for event codes.
 All occurrences of certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interesting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 event code number, along with individual arrival times, are placed in this
 buffer.
 Two interrupt condition are generated by the FIFO: not empty, and full.
 The first is asserted when the first event added, and cleared when the
 last event is removed.
 The second occurs when last free entry in the buffer is consumed.
 Further event occurrences are lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the not empty interrupt occurs the fifo drain task (named EVRFIFO in
 epicsThreadShowAll()) is woken up by a message queue.
 This task runs at scan high priority (90).
 Once awakened it will remove at most 512 event codes from the buffer before
 sleeping again.
 The number 512 is an arbitrary number chosen to prevent the starvation
 of lower priority tasks if a high frequency event code is accidentally
 mapped into the FIFO.
 A minimum sleep time is enforced by the 
\series bold
mrmEvrFIFOPeriod
\series default
 variable.
 This governs the maximum rate that events can be reported through the FIFO.
 Setting to 0 will disable it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the event codes 1-255 has an IOSCANPVT and a list of callback functions
 (type EVR::eventCallback) which will be invoked when the event occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An invocation of an IOSCANPVT list may place an arbitrary number of CALLBACKs
 into the message queue of the three EPICS callback scan tasks (High, Medium,
 and Low).
 If these message queues are overflowed then CALLBACK in other drivers my
 be lost.
 The scanIoRequest() function does not report this error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid this rather disastrous occurrence the EVR driver will not re-run
 the scan list for an event, until all actions 
\series bold
at all priorities
\series default
 from the previous run have finished.
 This is implemented by placing a special sentinel CALLBACK in all three
 queues.
 An event will not be re-run until all three of the CALLBACK have run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FIFO servicing code can indicate two error conditions.
 Occurrences of these errors are recorded in the 
\family typewriter
FIFO Overflow Count
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
FIFO Over rate
\family default
 counters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
FIFO Overflow Count
\family default
 gives the number of times the hardware FIFO buffer has overflowed.
 This is a serious error since arbitrary event code (including the timestamping
 codes) will be lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
FIFO Over rate
\family default
 counter counts the number of times any event reoccurred before the actions
 of the last occurrence were finished processing.
 This is less serious since other event codes are not effected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Buffer reception
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each EVR can receive a single data buffer.
 Once a data message has been received, the reception engine is disabled
 to allow time to download the buffer.
 Then the engine can be re-enabled in preparation for the next message.
 An interrupt is generated when the message has been fully received, and
 the engine disabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of a separate thread, buffer reception is implemented as a two stage
 callback run by the High (first) and Medium (second) priority scan tasks.
 The first callback copies the buffer into memory and immediately re-enables
 buffer reception, it then passes the data to the second callback.
 This callback passes the buffer to a list of user callback functions which
 have registered interest in the Protocol ID found in the message header.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Timestamp validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is impossible to verify a time without a second trusted reference.
 Since such a reference is not generally available, the driver can only
 make some checks against corruption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seconds part of the timestamp should only change when the 1Hz reset
 event (125) is received from the EVG.
 Therefore a callback is attached to that event code.
 When a new seconds value arrives it is compared to the previous stored
 value.
 If it is exactly 1 greater then it is taken to be the new seconds value.
 If it is not then the EVR time is declared invalid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the time is invalid, it can only become valid after five sequential
 seconds values are received.
 Any out of sequence value resets the count.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
EVR Device Support Reference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EPICS support module for MRF devices consists of a number of supports
 which are generally tied to a specific logical sub-unit.
 Each sub-unit may be thought of as an object having a number of properties.
 For example, each Delay Generator has properties 'Delay' and 'Width'.
 These properties can be read or modified in several ways.
 A delay can specified as an integer number of ticks of its reference clock
 (hardware view), or in seconds as a floating point number (user view).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example the properties 'Delay' and 'Width' should be settable in
 exact integer as well as the more useful, but imprecise, floating point
 units (eg.
 seconds).
 This needs to be accomplished by two different device supports (longout,
 and ao).
 Of course it is also useful to have some confirmation that settings have
 been applied so read-backs are desireable (longin, ai).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the device supports defined are as follows.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If disabled, an EVR will automatically enable when the event link becomes
 active.
 This allows for bumpless cold starts.
 For this reason the enable property should be included in any autosave
 request files.

PLL Lock Status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): bool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This indicates whether the phase locked loop which synchronizes an EVR's
 local oscilator with the phase of the EVG's oscilator.
 Outputs will not be stable unless the PLL is locked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except for immediately (
\begin_inset Formula $\ll1sec$
\end_inset

) after a change to the fractional synthesizer this property should always
 read as true (locked).
 Reading false for longer then one second is likely an indication that the
 fractional synthesize is misconfigured, or that a hardware fault has occured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Link Status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): bool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indicates when the event link is active.
 This means that the receiver sees light, and that valid data is being decoded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A reading of false may be caused by a number of conditions including: EVG
 down, fiber unplugged or broken, and/or incorrent fractional synthesizer
 frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Timestamp Valid
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): bool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indicates if the EVR has a current, valid timestamp.
 Condition under which the timestamp is declared invalid include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TS counter reset event received, but 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seconds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 value not updated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Found timestamp with previous invalid value.
 Catches old timestamp in buffers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 missed reset event)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): uint32
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The firmware version number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sw Version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Types(s): string
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A string describing the version of the driver software.
 This is captured when the driver is compiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
FIFO Overflow Count
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): uint32
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Counter the number of hardware event buffer overflows.
 There is a single hardware buffer for all event codes.
 When it overflows arbitrary events will fail to be delivered to software.
 This can cause the timestamp to falsely be invalidated, and can disrupt
 database processing which depends on event reception.
\end_layout

This is a serious error which should be corrected.

\begin_layout Standard
Counts overflows in all of the per event software buffers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This indicates that the period between successive events is shorter then
 the runtime of the code (callbacks, and database processing) that is causes.
 Extra events are being dropped and cause no action.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): uint32

\begin_layout Standard
The number of times the hardware heartbeat timer has expired.
 This indicates that the EVG is not sending event code 122 which may mean
 that it is misconfigured or hung.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): double
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequency of an EVR's local oscilator.
 This must be close enough to the EVG master oscilator to allow the phase
 locked loop in the EVR to lock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The native analog units are Hertz (Hz).
 This can be changed with the LINR and ESLO fields.
 Use ESLO of 1e-6 to allow user setting/reading in MHz.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Timestamp Clock
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): double
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifies the rate at which the timestamp event counter will be incremented.
 This determines the resolution of all timestamps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This setting is used in conjunction with the 'Timestamp Source'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the timestamp source is set to "Event clock" this property is used
 to compute an integer divider from the EVR's local oscilator frequency
 to the given frequency.
 Since this may not be exact it is recommended to read back the actual divider
 setting via the "Timestamp Prescaler" property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all modes this value is stored in memory and used to convert the timestamp
 event counter values from ticks to seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default the analog units are Hertz (Hz).
 This can be changed with the LINR and ESLO fields.
 Use ESLO of 1e-6 to allow user setting/reading in MHz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Timestamp Prescaler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type(s): uint32
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using the "Event clock" timestamp source this will return the actual
 divisor used.
 In other modes it reads 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\begin_layout Standard
Special device support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When processed creates a human readable string with either the current event
 link time, or the event link time when code # was last received.
 If Code is omitted or 0 then the current wall clock time is used.
 Code may also have any valid event number 1-255.
 Then it will print the time of the last received event.

Implemented for: waveform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a buffer with the given Protocol ID is received a copy is placed in
 this record.
 It is possible to have many records receiving the same Protocol ID.
 Data is received as a byte array and interpreted according to FTVL.
 For multi-byte types the transmission byte order is assumed to be big endian.
 Data is truncated to a multiple of the element size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many record (or other listeners) may register for the same Protocol ID.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The special Protocol ID 0xff00 may be used to cause a listener to receive
 messages destined for any ID.
