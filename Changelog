Version 2.0.2-dev

 Bug fixes

 * wrong width for RVAL causes endianness issue
 * re-enable of CML output during setMode not conditional
 * Fix EVG driver init w/o hardware.  This was crashing.
 * Update locking for EVR.  Take lock for all device support actions.

 Features

 * Compile in VCS version or release number.  Add a PV which reads this.
 * Read SFP EEPROM information (eg. module serial#, temperature, and
   incoming optical power).  Requires firmware >=5.  For version 5
   must be from 25 May 2012 or later.
 * Add mapping record for Prescaler reset action to the example EVR databases.
   Note: The default mapping for prescaler reset is now disabled.
         Anyone using this feature should update their databases
         to include this mapping record!

Version 2.0.1

 Bug fixes

 * Fix several vxWorks build issues
 * Correct initial mapping for EVR output channels to Force Low (aka. Off)
 * Fix readback of EVG sequencer run mode.
 * Limit number of soft event send retries
 * More check for EVG and EVR during initialization.
    Should now catch old firmware versions and CSR address mapping problems.
 * Delay enabling VME interrupts for EVG until later during IOC startup.
 * Fix autosave/restore of CML output bit patterns.
 * Remove rear transition module definitions from default EVG db template
 * Fix locking issue in data buffer tx/rx.
    A deadlock would occur when trying to send a buffer with the link mode
    set to dbus only.
 * Fix lockup when changing OUT field of event triggered records

 Features

 * Always reset all EVG multiplexed counters when a divider value is changed.
 * Added evralias.db to facilitate creation of PV name aliases for EVR
   delay generator channels.
 * Add counter to track number of times each EVG sequencer is run.
 * Add mrmEvrForward() shell function to configure EVR event forwarding to
   downstream EVRs.
